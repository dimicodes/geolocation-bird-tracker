<br>
This simple HTML and JavaScript application allows you to track the movement of a virtual "bird" on a map. 
<br>
It uses the Google Maps API and the HTML5 Geolocation API to simulate a bird's flight path.
<br>

# Usage
<br>

Open the HTML file index.html in a web browser.

Click the "Start" button to begin tracking the bird's movement.

The bird's starting latitude and longitude, as well as its current latitude and longitude, will be displayed on the page.

A map will show the bird's movement path, and a marker will indicate its current position.

The bird's position will update every 5 seconds to simulate its flight.
